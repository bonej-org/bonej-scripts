# bonej-scripts   [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6792892.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6792892)
Helper scripts and macros using BoneJ.

The intention of this repository is to archive and share code examples where BoneJ has been used from other code, in particular ImageJ macros or Jython / Python scripts. All examples of using BoneJ's API from client code are welcome.

There is no strict code style required and contributers are encouraged to share their work 'warts and all', early and often. It will help everyone (especially future you) if you include documentation in each script. Minimal documentation should include:

- The date
- Your name
- A description of what the code is meant to do
- Any related documents, such as the DOI and citation details of a publication for which the code was used
- A licence

It is helpful to include line-by-line documentation so that the intention of each piece of code is clear.

Files uploaded here remain the intellectual property of their authors and are made available under licence terms set in each file by the authors.

Code is automatically archived at [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6792892) with DOI, and can be cited from there. Note that the Zenodo DOI changes as the code is updated. Best practice is to cite the DOI specific to the 'version of record' of your scripts. The DOI linked from this README is the universal one that always resolves to the latest code version.
